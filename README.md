base26 ([A-Z]) and base52 ([A-Za-z]) encodings
</div>

## overview

transform any string to alphabetic-only with base26 ([A-Z]) and base52 ([A-Za-z]) lossless encodings; useful for transmitting textual data over restrictive channels or for training AI models and tokenizers on simpler vocabularies.

**alphacodings** is a fast and lightweight C++ library; bindings are available via pybind11.

## installation

```python
python -m pip install alphacodings
```

## usage

TBC

## motivation

The library is inspired by [R. Heaton](https://github.com/robert)'s base26 implementation in the [pyskyWiFi](https://github.com/robert/PySkyWiFi) repository and his story on how to manipulate data transmission in restrictive network channels via alphabetic-only encodings and tokenization.

have a look at the original repository and [story blog post](https://robertheaton.com/pyskywifi) and show him some love!
