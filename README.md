# alphacodings

base26 ([A-Z]) and base52 ([A-Za-z]) encodings.

## overview

transform any string to an alphabetic-only string with base26 ([A-Z]) and base52 ([A-Za-z]) lossless encoding; useful for transmitting textual data over alphabetic-only or constrained channels or for training AI models and tokenizers on simpler vocabularies.

**alphacodings** is a fast and lightweight C++ library without third-party dependencies; bindings are available via pybind11.

## installation

```python
python -m pip install alphacodings
```

## usage

TBC

## motivation

The library is inspired by R. Heaton's base26 implementation in the [pyskyWiFi](https://github.com/robert/PySkyWiFi) repository and his story on how to manipulate data transmission in constrained network channels via alphabetic-only encoding and tokenization; have a look at the original repository or story and show him some love!
