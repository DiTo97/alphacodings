# alphacodings

base26 ([A-Z]) and base52 ([A-Za-z]) encodings.

## overview

transform any string to an alphabetic-only string with base26 ([A-Z]) and base52 ([A-Za-z]) lossless encoding; useful for transmitting textual data over alphabetic-only or constrained channels or for training AI models and tokenizers on simpler vocabularies.

**alphacodings** is a fast and lightweight C++ library without dependencies; python bindings are available.

## installation

```python
python -m pip install alphacodings
```

## usage

TBC

## motivation

The library is inspired by @robert's [pyskyWiFi](https://github.com/robert/PySkyWiFi) story and repository on how to manipulate constrained channels via alphabetic-only transmission; have a read to the original repository and show him some love!
